# 2D-Particle-Tracking-and-Postprocessing
Tracks particles in a single camera video and computes all high order statistics.

First execute track_particles.m. It will give you matlab structures with filtered trajectories, velocity and acceleration.

Then, execute process_trajs.m. It plots MSD, S2L, pdfs, and auto-correlations.
